The .zip file in this directory contains an Xcode project which demonstrates an iOS app issue we've run into with
WKWebView and external web content in our app Frax. Build and run on an older device (pre iOS 17.5) to see the
expected behavior (the web view bounces a few times and loads the expected content without errors), or on a newer
device (iOS 17.5+) to see the problematic behavior and console errors. Thanks in advance for any help, and looking
forward to finding a solution for this!
